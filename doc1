The network access layer is concerned with the exchange of data between a
computer and the network to which it is attached. The sending computer must pro-
vide the network with the address of the destination computer, so that the network
may route the data to the appropriate destination. The sending computer may wish
to invoke certain services, such as priority, that might be provided by the network.
The specific software used at this layer depends on the type of network to be used;
different standards have been developed for circuit switching, packet switching,
local area networks, and others. Thus, it makes sense to separate those functions
having to do with network access into a separate layer. By doing this, the remain-
der of the communications software, above the network access layer, need not be
concerned with the specifics of the network to be used. The same higher-layer soft-
ware should function properly regardless of the particular network to which the
computer is attached.
